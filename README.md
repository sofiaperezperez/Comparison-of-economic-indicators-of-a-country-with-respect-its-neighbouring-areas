# Comparison-of-economic-indicators-of-a-country-with-respect-its-neighbouring-areas
In order to gain insight into some actions taken by the countries regarding economic aspects, a  study in Excel has been developed. It includes the evolution from 2005 to 2015 of some indicators, such  as the percentage of fuel exports and imports, the electricity access in rural and urban zones,  and the usage of renewable and fossil fuels.  This study informs about the current situation of a chosen country, as well as the explanation of  some actions taken and their consequences. It is also compared to the averaged values of the  region it belongs to, in order to obtain a deeper knowledge of its global position.
